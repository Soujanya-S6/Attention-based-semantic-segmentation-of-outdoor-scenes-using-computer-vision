# DABNet: Depth-wise Asymmetric Bottleneck for Real-time Semantic Segmentation

<h2>Overview</h2><br>
This project presents DABNet (Depth-wise Asymmetric Bottleneck), a lightweight architecture designed for real-time semantic segmentation tasks. DABNet leverages depth-wise convolutional layers and asymmetric bottlenecks to achieve a balance between model complexity and segmentation accuracy, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

<h2>Dependencie</h2>s<br>
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python (>=3.6)
* TensorFlow (>=2.0)
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:<br>
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib

<h2>Dataset</h2><br>
You'll need a dataset of outdoor scenes annotated with semantic segmentation labels.
