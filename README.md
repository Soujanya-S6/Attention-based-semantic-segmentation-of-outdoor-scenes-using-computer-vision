# DABNet: Depth-wise Asymmetric Bottleneck for Real-time Semantic Segmentation

Overview
This project presents DABNet (Depth-wise Asymmetric Bottleneck), a lightweight architecture designed for real-time semantic segmentation tasks. DABNet leverages depth-wise convolutional layers and asymmetric bottlenecks to achieve a balance between model complexity and segmentation accuracy, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
